Hi, Abhishek This side!!

# Project Title

## Overview

This project was developed from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Due to restrictions on my company laptop that prevented the installation of external modules, I later converted the project to Angular. This transition allowed me to leverage Angular's powerful features while adhering to the constraints of my development environment.

## Project Description

This web application showcases a clean and modern design, providing users with a smooth and interactive experience. The key features of the project include:

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
  
- **Interactive Components**: 
  - **Dialog Box**: Implemented in both the Projects and Contact sections, the dialog box provides feedback to users. When a project is selected, a modal appears showcasing project details. In the Contact section, upon submitting the form, a confirmation dialog informs users that their message has been sent successfully.
  
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and hover effects enhance user interaction, providing a polished feel to the overall application. Elements like buttons and inputs include animations that respond to user actions, improving engagement.

## Features

- **Projects Section**: 
  - Users can view a list of projects, each represented by a title and image. Clicking on a project opens a dialog box with detailed information.
  
- **Contact Section**:
  - Users can fill out a contact form to get in touch. Required fields ensure that essential information is collected. Upon submission, a dialog confirms that the message has been sent.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Angular18
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for styling and animations, ensuring responsiveness.
